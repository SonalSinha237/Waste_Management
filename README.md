# IoT Based Waste Management System

This project proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) based waste management system which aims to segregate the waste materials as wet and dry. Depending on the level of garbage collected in the bins, the level data is sent to the ThingSpeak channel. Location of the dustbin is already entered in the channel. As soon the level value reaches a certain threshold point, the red alert light on the channel notifies the person to empty the bin.

## Components required:

* Arduino UNO
* Ultrasonic sensor
* Water sensor
* Servo motor
* Red LED light
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard

## Future Scope:

* It can also measure weight which can work as one of the parameters to notify the authority.
* It can help the waste management authority or municipality to manage the dustbins on a large scale. This will also help in keeping the city clean.
* Segregation can be done on the basis of material of waste also, eg: metal and non-metal.
